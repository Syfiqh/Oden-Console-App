# Oden-Console-App
This is a simple C++ console application that simulates a self-service ordering system for an oden food stall. Customers can customize their orders by choosing the type of noodles, soup, and optional add-ons, along with the quantity. The program then generates a formatted receipt with individual item prices and the total cost.
